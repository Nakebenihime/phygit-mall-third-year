PhyGit Mall (PGM) is a real estate company specialized in the construction of shopping centers. Recently it has embarked on a project to build a connected shopping mall. Connected commerce consists of the integration between digital commerce (e-commerce) and traditional commerce (physical stores). It allows the consumer, for example, to locate products in a store before buying them on the website of one of the center's merchants ("showrooming"), or proceed in the opposite direction ("webrooming"). It also allows him, thanks to the digitalization of the points of sale (making digital tools available to salesmen and consumers in the store) to find the same services in the shopping center and online. Therefore, the main difference with a traditional shopping mall resides in the " Self-care " organization, which allows the consumer to access a wide range of information and services independently and in real time.
